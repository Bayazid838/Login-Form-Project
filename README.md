# Login Form

Welcome to my **Login Form Project**! This is a sleek and responsive login form, created with HTML and CSS, aimed at providing an elegant, user-friendly experience. With custom icons, modern styling, and smooth animations, this project serves as a great starting point for anyone looking to design a functional login interface.

As someone passionate about **web development**, **coding**, and **UI/UX design**, this form demonstrates my progress in improving my front-end skills, particularly in HTML and CSS. I believe that a well-designed form is crucial for the user experience, and this project reflects my commitment to mastering these concepts.

## About the Project

This **Login Form** is designed to look both **modern** and **professional**. It’s built with the goal of being intuitive, easy to use, and responsive across different devices. The form consists of input fields for username, password, a "remember me" checkbox, and a link for forgotten passwords. 

### Technologies Used:
- **HTML**: The backbone of the project, used to structure the form and its elements.
- **CSS**: Styled the form with a **clean purple theme**, using **Poppins** for the font and **Boxicons** for interactive icons in input fields.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes using flexbox and media queries, ensuring a great user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

This project also incorporates the following:
- **Input fields** with **placeholder text** for guidance.
- **Icons** in the input fields for an intuitive, visual experience.
- **Hover effects** on the login button and links for interactivity.
- **Remember me** checkbox functionality and a **forgot password** link for future extensions.
